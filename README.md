Drag and drop functionality may not work on mobile devices due to the differences in touch events compared to desktop devices. To make drag and drop work on mobile devices, you can use a library like `angular-dragdrop` or `ngDraggable`.

Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. Include the library in your project:

```
<script src="(link unavailable)"></script>
```

1. Add the library as a dependency in your AngularJS app:

```
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngDragDrop']);
```

1. Use the `ng-drag` and `ng-drop` directives to enable drag and drop functionality:

```
<div ng-drag="true">Drag me!</div>
<div ng-drop="true">Drop here!</div>
```

1. Handle the drag and drop events using the `ng-dragstart`, `ng-dragend`, `ng-drop`, and `ng-dragover` directives:

```
<div ng-drag="true" ng-dragstart="onDragStart($event)">Drag me!</div>
<div ng-drop="true" ng-drop="onDrop($event)">Drop here!</div>
```

In your controller:

```
$scope.onDragStart = function($event) {
  // Handle drag start event
};

$scope.onDrop = function($event) {
  // Handle drop event
};
```

Note that you may need to adjust the library and code to fit your specific requirements.

Alternatively, you can also use `ngTouch` module to handle touch events and implement custom drag and drop functionality. However, using a library like `angular-dragdrop` or `ngDraggable` can simplify the proces

Here is an example code using AngularJS and `ngDraggable` library:

HTML:

```
<div class="container" ng-controller="MyController">
  <div class="box" ng-repeat="box in boxes" ng-draggable ng-model="box" ng-drop="true">
    Box {{(link unavailable)}}
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS:

```
.container {
  width: 800px;
  height: 600px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  position: relative;
}

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  position: absolute;
  cursor: move;
}
```

JavaScript:

```
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngDraggable']);

app.controller('MyController', function($scope) {
  $scope.boxes = [
    {id: 1, x: 10, y: 10},
    {id: 2, x: 150, y: 10},
    {id: 3, x: 10, y: 150},
    {id: 4, x: 150, y: 150},
    {id: 5, x: 300, y: 10}
  ];

  $scope.$on('dragStart', function(event, data) {
    console.log('Drag started:', data);
  });

  $scope.$on('dragEnd', function(event, data) {
    console.log('Drag ended:', data);
  });

  $scope.$on('drop', function(event, data) {
    console.log('Dropped:', data);
  });
});
```

In this example, we have a container with 5 boxes that can be dragged and dropped. The `ng-draggable` directive makes the boxes draggable, and the `ng-drop` directive allows them to be dropped. The `ng-model` directive binds the box data to the scope.

Note that you need to include the `ngDraggable` library in your HTML file and add it as a dependency in your AngularJS app.

Also, you can adjust the CSS to fit your specific requirements.
